Abstract

Online retail market has been the fastest growing shopping trend worldwide during last decade. All famous large retailers in the world has opened up an online shopping window to cater to the need of their customers. In the age of globalization, online retailing has expanded the customer base from being limited to boundary of any specific geographic location. For example, customers in UK now can search, verify, judge and order any quality product from USA. However, for both large and small retailers, this has created an immense pressure and put them in fierce completion to maintain market share let alone expand. Hence, Data Analysis to analyze customersâ€™ purchasing behavior, understanding the shopping pattern, having idea on their likes, dislikes have become increasingly important to retain success.    

On the basis of above, I am proposing a project that aims at performing an exploratory analysis on an online retail dataset. The objective of this analysis would be to predict the trends of online purchasing, forecast expected revenue trend and identify underlying relations among the products that customers tend to buy together.    

Dataset

The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers .
